## Project Overview

**Gaze** is an AI-powered face analysis web application that detects faces in images and predicts gender and age using deep learning. It uses a pretrained CNN model (VGG-Face backbone) via the DeepFace library for accurate predictions.

This project was built as a **full-stack web application** combining:
- **Frontend**: Modern HTML/CSS/JavaScript with dark theme UI
- **Backend**: Python Flask REST API
- **AI/ML**: DeepFace + OpenCV for face detection and classification

## How It Works

```
User uploads image / captures from webcam
                │
                ▼
    Frontend (index.html)
    Sends image to API
                │
                ▼
    Backend (app.py - Flask)
    Receives image, decodes it
                │
                ▼
    OpenCV detects face(s)
                │
                ▼
    DeepFace predicts:
    - Gender (Male/Female)
    - Age range (25-32)
                │
                ▼
    Returns JSON response
                │
                ▼
    Frontend displays results
    with confidence bars
```

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.11 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- Internet connection (for first run only - downloads model weights)

### Step 1: Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/codeby-jayesh/ai-face-analysis-project.git
cd ai-face-analysis-project
```

### Step 2: Install dependencies
```bash
cd backend
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 3: Run the application
```bash
python app.py
```

### Step 4: Open in browser
```
http://localhost:5000
```

## API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/api/health` | Health check |
| `POST` | `/api/predict` | Predict gender & age |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/predict` | Predict (v1 API) |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/stats` | Get statistics |

### Example Request
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/predict \
  -F "image=@photo.jpg"
```

### Example Response
```json
{
  "request_id": "a1b2c3d4",
  "faces_detected": 1,
  "faces": [
    {
      "gender": "Man",
      "gender_scores": {"Man": 98.5, "Woman": 1.5},

## Model Details

| Model | Accuracy | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| Gender | ~95% | VGG-Face based CNN classifier |
| Age | ~90% | Age range classifier (8 groups) |
| Face Detection | ~98% | OpenCV Haar Cascade detector |

**Model Weights**: Downloaded automatically on first run from GitHub releases.

---

## Challenges Faced

1. **Model Download**: DeepFace models are large (500MB+) and need internet for first download
2. **CORS Issues**: Frontend and backend run on different ports, needed CORS configuration
3. **Image Processing**: Converting between PIL, OpenCV, and numpy formats
4. **Rate Limiting**: Implementing IP-based rate limiting without Redis
5. **File Cleanup**: Managing uploaded files to prevent disk space issues

---

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Add race detection (model download pending)
- [ ] Add emotion detection
- [ ] Add user authentication
- [ ] Store prediction history in database
- [ ] Add batch processing (multiple images)
- [x] Deploy to cloud (Render/Railway)
- [ ] Add dark/light theme toggle
- [ ] Mobile app (React Native)
